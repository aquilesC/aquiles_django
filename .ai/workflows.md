# Development Workflows

## Git Workflow

### Commit Strategy
- **Atomic Commits** - Each commit should represent a single, complete change
- **Semantic Messages** - Use conventional commit format
- **Phase Commits** - Always commit after completing each development phase
- **Feature Branches** - Use branches for major features or experiments

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(blog): add pagination to blog listing
fix(accounts): resolve login redirect issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Branch Management
```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/new-blog-system
# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat(blog): implement blog post model"
git push origin feature/new-blog-system
# Merge to main after review
```

## Development Process

### Local Development Setup
1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run watch:css  # Development mode
   ```

4. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Feature Development Workflow
1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Review existing code and architecture
   - Plan database changes if needed

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Create models and migrations
   - Implement views and business logic
   - Create templates and frontend components
   - Add tests for new functionality

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Run unit tests: `python manage.py test`
   - Manual testing of functionality
   - Cross-browser and responsive testing
   - Accessibility testing

4. **Review Phase**
   - Code review (self-review or peer review)
   - Documentation updates
   - Performance review

5. **Deployment Phase**
   - Merge to main branch
   - Deploy to staging/production
   - Monitor for issues

### Daily Development Routine
```bash
# Start of day
git pull origin main
source venv/bin/activate
npm run watch:css &
python manage.py runserver

# During development
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py test

# End of day
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user dashboard"
git push origin feature-branch
```

## Testing Workflow

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Write Test** - Create failing test for new functionality
2. **Implement** - Write minimal code to make test pass
3. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run specific app tests
python manage.py test blog

# Run with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
coverage html
```

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
- **Functional Tests** - Test user workflows
- **Performance Tests** - Test response times and load handling

## Deployment Workflow

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Database migrations created and tested
- [ ] Static files compiled: `npm run build:css`
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Dependencies updated in requirements.txt
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Deployment Steps (DigitalOcean)
1. **Prepare for Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Collect static files
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   
   # Run database migrations
   python manage.py migrate
   
   # Create production build
   npm run build:css
   ```

2. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   # Deploy code
   git push production main
   
   # SSH to server
   ssh user@your-server.com
   
   # Update dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Run migrations
   python manage.py migrate
   
   # Collect static files
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   
   # Restart services
   sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Check site functionality
   - Verify database connections
   - Test critical user workflows
   - Monitor error logs

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push production main

# Or rollback database migrations if needed
python manage.py migrate app_name previous_migration
```

## Code Review Workflow

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met

### Review Process
1. **Self-Review** - Author reviews their own code first
2. **Automated Checks** - Linting, tests, security scans
3. **Peer Review** - Team member reviews code
4. **Approval** - Code approved for merge
5. **Merge** - Feature merged to main branch

## Maintenance Workflow

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- **Weekly**: Update dependencies, review security alerts
- **Monthly**: Performance monitoring, backup verification
- **Quarterly**: Security audit, dependency cleanup

### Dependency Management
```bash
# Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated
npm outdated

# Update packages
pip install --upgrade package-name
npm update

# Update requirements file
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Database Maintenance
```bash
# Backup database
python manage.py dumpdata > backup.json

# Clean up old migrations (carefully)
python manage.py squashmigrations app_name 0001 0005
```
