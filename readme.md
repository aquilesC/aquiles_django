# Personal Website for Aquiles 

I want to build a personal website where I can show the things I have done, what I am currently doing and learning, and where I can keep posting articles (in Blog format). 

## Requirements

- Django + Wagtail for the CMS
- Use Django's MVT system
- Allow users to register to the website to access exclusive content 
- Use git with descriptive commit messages 



## Backend
- Follow .cursorrules
- Use Django's best practices for security
- Strictly separate business logic from design 
- Keep the logic in the models and form validation
- Keep templates as lean as possible, with as little logic as possible. 

## Design
- Clarity over cleverness: prioritize legibility, structure, and honest content.
- Scientific elegance: minimal forms, precise spacing, restrained color, high contrast.
- Performance-first: minimal DOM, no unnecessary scripts, responsive images.
- use visual_style.md

## Frontend
- Use the Django Templates 
- Use TailwindCSS for styling 

## Infrastructure
- git
- Locally tested
- Deployed to Digital Ocean
